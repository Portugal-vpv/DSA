# Data Structures Implementation

## Overview
This project provides implementations of the most common data structures in a structured and easy-to-understand manner. It includes various data structures with their respective methods and operations, along with examples of how to use them.

## Features
- Implementation of fundamental data structures
- Well-documented code with examples
- Efficient algorithms and best practices
- Unit tests for each data structure

## Data Structures Implemented
### Linear Data Structures
- **Array**: Dynamic and Static Arrays
- **Linked List**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists
- **Stack**: LIFO structure with push, pop, and peek operations
- **Queue**: FIFO structure, including Circular Queue and Priority Queue

### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Hash Table**: Key-value storage with efficient lookup
- **Heap**: Min Heap and Max Heap
- **Tree**:
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree (BST)
    - AVL Tree
    - Trie
- **Graph**: Adjacency List and Matrix representations with BFS and DFS traversal
